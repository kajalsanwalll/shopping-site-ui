# Amazon Clone 

Recreated the homepage UI of Amazon using **HTML & CSS** to level up my front-end skills fr.

## Features
- Navbar + search bar layout
- Hero/banner section
- Product cards arranged using **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
- Footer section
- Image assets integrated using relative paths
- Clean UI spacing, hover effects, alignment (after pain)

## What I learned
- Structuring a web page like a real industry popup trauma
- CSS Grid & Flexbox for horizontal & responsive-ish layout
- Relative vs absolute asset paths
- Git basics & pushing projects to **GitHub**
- Debugging UI like my life depends on it

## Tech used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- GitHub for code hosting

##  Future upgrades planned
- Add responsiveness for mobile & tablet
- Maybe add interactions later (cart, clicks, etc)
- Backend era sometime later maybe

>  This is a UI clone made for learning and skill building. Not for commercial use.
